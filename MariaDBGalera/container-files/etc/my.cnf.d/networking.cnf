# When a client connects, the server will perform hostname resolution, 
# and when DNS is slow, establishing the connection will become slow as well. 
# It is therefore recommended to start the server with skip-name-resolve to 
# disable all DNS lookups. The only limitation is that the GRANT statements 
# must then use IP addresses only.
